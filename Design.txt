Design Dicisions
----------------
Guess the Word is a word guessing game Api built on AppEngine.
The Api is intended to serve as a backend for the game.

All user actions a recorded. 
Games are created by users and can be played by other users and multiple games can be played
all a the same time.

One of the goals of the Api is to provide a simple way of accepting user input and returning results.
This is achieved by using ProtoRPC messages which is a framework for implementing HTTP-based remote 
procedure call (RPC) services.

Another one of the goals of this Api is to be able to persist data and so all data that require to
be persisted are stored on AppEngine's Datastore.

Often game players try to cheat when they play. Some measures have been put in place to handle some
of those actions. eg. A completed or a cancelled game cannot be played, etc. 

In order to have an Api that responds in a timely fashion, I have seperated tasks that are not required to 
return immediate response to users from the ones that do. Those long running tasks are run as cron jobs 
on AppEngine's Task Queues. 

Having the above mentioned goals in mind as well as the requirements of the project, the Api has been 
written to meet those specified requirements and goals.
