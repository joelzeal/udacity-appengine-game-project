#Full Stack Nanodegree Project 4 Refresh

## Set-Up Instructions:
1.  Update the value of application in app.yaml to the app ID you have registered
 in the App Engine admin console and would like to use to host your instance of this sample.
2.  Run the app with the devserver using dev_appserver.py DIR, and ensure it's
 running by visiting the API Explorer - by default localhost:8080/_ah/api/explorer.
3.  (Optional) Generate your client library(ies) with the endpoints tool.
 Deploy your application.


##Game Description:
Guess the word is a simple guessing game. Each game begins with a random 'target'
word from a list of random words, and provided maximum number of
'attempts'. 'Guesses' are sent to the `make_move` endpoint which will reply
with either: 'Your guess was right', 'Your guess was wrong', 'you win', or 'game over' 
(if the maximum number of attempts is reached).
Many different Guess the Word games can be played by many different Users at any
given time. Each game can be retrieved or played by using the path parameter
'urlsafe_game_key'.

###Score Keeping
Each time a player makes a right guess the letter is inserted into the the word and
the player continues to guess until he completes the word. If the player successfully
completes the word, he wins the game and a 'won' flag is set to true in the score model 
for that game. Anytime a player makes a wrong guess an attemps counter is reduced by one.
If a player runs out of attempts its game over.
